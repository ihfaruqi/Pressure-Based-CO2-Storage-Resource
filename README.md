# Pressure-based CO2 Storage Resource

Simple algorithm to estimate the total pressure-limited CO2 storage resource. This storage capacity consider the limit of CO2 flow and displaced brine.

The code itself is based on an adaptation from the paper titled "Pressure Space: The Key Subsurface Commodity for CCS" by Alexander P. Bump and Susan Hovorka, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, Volume 136, July 2024, 104174. The DOI for the paper is [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2024.104174](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2024.104174). Please cite this paper when using the code.

This tool is best for regional or basin-scale evaluation to screen the most suitable CO2 storage site based on both subsurface and surface element relevant for permanent geological carbon sequestration. For this particular example, the work works based in a tectonically relaxed, offshore setting. The example comes from Outer Continental Shelf, Northern Gulf of Mexico basin is as follow:

1D Model will be available soon. Manuscript for this paper is currently being prepared.
